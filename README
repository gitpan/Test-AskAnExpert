Test-AskAnExpert version 0.03
=====================

Test::AskAnExpert provides an abstraction layer for human checks. If you are in an
environment where you often have to manually check with an expert after a test
to ensure your program is working properly Test::AskAnExpert will automate this
process for you, allowing the expert to answer the yes/no questions and provide
feedback and you the developer to recieve pretty TAP output that you can feed
into your favorite testing tool, all inside a make test.
